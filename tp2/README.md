## Group T13G01

## TP2 Notes

In comparison to last week's exercise, we found this one to be a little trickier, mostly due to the following points:

- Having to calculate each measure manually for the transformations
- In exercise 2, needing to define the transformation matrices also manually, accompanied by having to define the matrices with their transpose.

Other than that, the exercises were relatively simple.
